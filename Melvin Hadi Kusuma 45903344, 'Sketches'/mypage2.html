			This site holds drawings that I've created as a result of my loving
			interest in art as a pastime, as well as the flexibility and possibilites
			of using a graphics tablet to draw.
			
			<br><br>
			
			I most often draw random female characters in arbitrary poses and clothing. However, with my unpolished
			drawings, I usually like to draw fiction themes.

			<p class="para">
			I've always enjoyed just drawing and sketching what's appeared on my mind when I was a young child.
			I would frequently show off what I drew to friends and family. But, clumsily, I would always tend to
			lose or damage the drawings I've made. 
			
			<br><br>
			
			It was when I reached my 14th birthday that I recieved my first graphics tablet, and it was absolutely
			fantastic. One of the many reasons being; I would never lose my drawings, and they would never naturally deteriorate. 
			I could come back to edit or view them while they maintain their crisp resolution because they were drawn digitally.

			<p class="para">
			So, with my drawings being able to be stored as digital data, I
			want to show them off to not only my friends and family, but to all viewers online.
